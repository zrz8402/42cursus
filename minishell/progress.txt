first ddl: 3.7 Friday
second ddl: 3.9 Sunday


~ 3.2 finish built-in commands (basic)
built_in commands
- echo ~
- cd ~
- pwd ~
- export
- unset ~
- env ~
- exit ~

Things left:
	decide whether update envp or not
	export without, undefined or print all

change lex_list to
  redir array
  cmd array

redir + process
	pipes
		- pipe()
		need to close it
	pids
		-fork()
		-waitpid()

cleanup()


TO BE DECIDED:
ONLY change pwd and oldpwd in both envp and envlst
(or make it even easier, do not change any in envp)
	-> relates to cd
	-> if change both
		could be done when finding shlvl?
		save index of pwd and oldpwd somewhere if we don't plan to change other env var
export -> change envlst
