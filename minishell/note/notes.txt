1. prepare out files
	loop through (|) 
		<< heredoc has highest priority, if we use (normal) ctrl+c forcing to exit, the whole process stops(why signal plays a role). So if there are <<s, we will process them first and save the result in heredoc[i][2] pipes(with marking where they should go later).

		Then we will check < and > in order. If any fails, it stops here.
			if (< in): infile does't exit or we have no permission to read it, stop;
			if (> out | >> out): if no out, creat out
						if no write permission, stop

2. process
	redirection part
		redirect in/here_doc and out in order with dup2()
		dup2(in, STDIN_FILENO)
		dup2(out, STDOUT_FILENO)
	execute part
		built-in commands(may work differently)
		[cmd, options, arguments, NULL];
		cmd - parse cmd
		// to-do: understand how to work with $(VARIABLE)
		// to-do: understand how to make built-in cmds work


echo -n 
	print text without newline
	write()

cd (with a relative or absolute path)
	chdir() --#include <stdio.h>

	set environment variables
  =>

		print all env variables with format like in order:

	case 2: export A
		add variable A to env_list, its value = NULL
