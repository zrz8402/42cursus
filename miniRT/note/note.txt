Tasks:
1. Parsing input

2. Ray tracing part
	geometric objects: plane, sphere, cylinder
	handle possible intersections and the insides of the objects
	resize properties of objects: 
			sphere: diameter
			cylinder: width & height
	apply translation and rotation transformations to objects, lights, and cameras
	Light management:
		spot brightness
		hard shadows
		ambient lighting
		diffuse lighting
